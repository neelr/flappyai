# Flappy Bird AI

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/neelr/flappyai)](https://repl.it/github/neelr/flappyai)

A Flappy Bird AI using reinforcement learning, built from scratch (only core JS libraries), using just normal js arrays. It mutates the best AI flappy bird into 500 and keeps repeating! You can play with the birds by clicking any key (you are red). Click God AI to play against a fully trained bird! While building this project I learned about neuroevolution and how AI really works!

### Running

Running the code is as easy as just clicking the "Run on Repl.it" button! For local development, you can clone the repo, and then open `index.html` in your browser of choice (all imports are relative)!
