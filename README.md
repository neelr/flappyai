# Flappy Bird AI

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/neelr/flappyai)](https://repl.it/github/neelr/flappyai)

A Flappy Bird AI using reinforcement learning, built from scratch (only core JS libraries), using just normal js arrays. It mutates the best AI flappy bird into 500 and keeps repeating! You can play with the birds by clicking any key (you are red). Click God AI to play against a fully trained bird!

Building this project I learned about neuroevolution and how AI really works!

Unclicensed, so do whatever you want with it!
